This [project](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_19/) implements Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms in selecting informative predictors for a modelling problem using the Random Forest and Linear Discriminant Analysis structures. The resulting predictions derived from the candidate models applying both Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms were evaluated in terms of their discrimination power using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) metric. The AUROC values were compared to those of the baseline models which made use of the full data without any form of feature selection, or implemented a model-specific feature selection process.
